# Kuva-Rakodzi Ventilator

After prototyping a manually-cranked ventilator from commonly available materials and for less than $5 in Zimbabwe, this project is now focusing efforts on developing an open-source field ventilator kit, including 3D printable and injection mouldable CAD designs and SLT files which can be used to assemble a ventilator for CPAP or invasive ventilation in areas with unreliable or non-existent power sources.

The initial ventilator design uses a crank and handle assembly, lifting and dropping a weighted submerged bell-jar compressor, the output of which feeds a crankshaft-actuated synchronous rotary valve which times the pressurised breathing cycle.
